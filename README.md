# Introduction

Freebee is a blockchain based freelancing platform where companies can list their jobs and freelancers can apply for various jobs listed on the portal. This repository contains the Smart Contract, Test File and Deploy Scripts for the project. The project is built using 'Hardhat' which is simply an environment to write, test and deply smart contracts. Hardhat provides some fake accounts with some fake ethers that can be used to test the execution of various functions in the smart contract.

The 'contracts' folder contains the smart conntract in the name of 'FreeLancing.sol' which is written in 'Solidity' language. It contains all the logic behind the execution of various transactions in the crowdfunding application. It includes functions like creation of a job, making resume, hiring freelaners, aplpying for jobs, etc. Whenever any user executes a transaction in client side, a call will be made to the corresponding function of the smart contract.

The 'test' folder contains the test file 'FreelancingTest.js' which is used to test various functions of the Smart Contract before actually deploying it to blockchain. For this purpose, the fake ethers provided by hardhat are used.

The 'scripts' folder contains a file 'deploy.js' which is used to deploy the smart contract to actual blockchain.
